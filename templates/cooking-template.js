  <p>
    On this page you'll find recipes I've tried! You'll see that I love
    cooking and baking. I often use my air-fryer, stand-mixer, and
    pressure cooker to experiment with. My partner is a diabetic so
    we're always trying to find new and healthier ways to create
    delicious food!

            I was inspired to make this recipe when a co-worker said she
            had tried it and enjoyed it. I also enjoy anything with puff
            pastry and butter.
          </li>
          <li>
            This recipe was a little complicated but tasted alright in
            the end. I think the puff pastry may have been too thin.

            This recipe was delicious! But I had a lot of help from
            other people at The Gathering Table.

            We also prepared a really good Thai Chicken Soup. There was
            a lot of waiting around while food cooked but otherwise the
            experience was enjoyable.

            I made this cake for my partner's birthday. He likes golf so
            I made it golf-themed.
          </li>
          <li>
            This actually tasted pretty terrible and I wouldn't bake it
            again.

          <li>But it looked nice!</li>
